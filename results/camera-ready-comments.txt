put the diagram before

leave out timeout

section 5: web content monetization -- mention if this were to be used with the real ethereum, this is how many clients we would need. (a small paragraph)

scalability -- it can be run independently (limited interaction with server makes it more scalable, not necessarily efficient)

reviewer 2:

in the experiments -- talk about how it doesn't take much more time, even though it takes a lot more hashes.

--------------------------------------
future work (for ourself):

where is the turning point for the hash rate
timeout
scalability

------------------------------------------------------------
why 99.999995% (maybe fully fill the buffer instead of this wierd random number -- within 10-e6 percent full)

think about analysis -- conservative part (is it really more conservative?)

replace the bounds with the estimate
